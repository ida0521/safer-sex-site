      <h3>What are STIs and BBVs?</h3>
      <p>Sex workers use vaccination, safer-sex tools (PPE), and testing as safer sex measures to protect against STIs and BBVs, and to maintain sexual health. Learn more: <a href="https://redbook.scarletalliance.org.au/sti-bbv/" target="_blank">Red Book STI/BBV</a>.</p>

      <h3>How to Check Clients for Visible Signs of STI</h3>
      <p>You can’t tell just by looking if someone has an STI or BBV, but knowing the signs and symptoms can help. Use gloves and ensure your client has showered before checking their genitals and mouth.

      <h3>Safer Sex Tools</h3>
